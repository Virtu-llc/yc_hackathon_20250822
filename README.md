# LastMile Agent
**The last mile of agent adoption in traditional industries.**

Agentic AI has already shown impressive capabilities in areas like deep research, voice AI customer service, and more. Yet, when it comes to adoption in traditional industries, the gap remains significant.
Insurance, banking, and healthcare still rely heavily on outdated workflows: processes run locally on Excel, local file-based databases, and legacy desktop software. On top of that, strict data privacy and compliance requirements often prevent sensitive data from moving to the cloud, leaving AI disconnected from daily operational work.

**LastMile Agent** is designed to bridge this gap between AI agents and traditional operations.
It makes local software actions available as agent tools, so agents can not only leverage cloud-based services but also integrate directly with legacy systems and desktop applications. This enables agents to truly operate in traditional industries — delivering the “last mile” of automation and making real-world deployment possible.
